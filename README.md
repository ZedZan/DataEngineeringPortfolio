# Week 1 - Day 1: SQL Practice

## Description
This project contains SQL queries practicing:
- Joins between multiple tables (`users`, `orders`, `products`)
- Calculations per order (quantity * price)
- Aggregations: total sales per user
- Sorting results by total_price

## Dataset
- `users.csv`: list of users
- `products.csv`: list of products
- `orders.csv`: list of orders

## Queries
1. Join users + orders + products to show each order with user info, product, quantity, and total price.
2. Aggregate total sales per user and order by highest spender.
