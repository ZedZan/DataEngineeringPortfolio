# 🧪 Data Engineering Learning Roadmap — Daily Progress

Welcome to my Data Engineering learning journey!  
This repository contains my **daily hands-on practice**, covering SQL, Python, Data Modeling, ETL, Airflow, Spark, Cloud, and more.

I follow a structured roadmap and complete one “day” at a time.  
Each day has its own folder with:
- A README describing the objectives
- SQL/Python notebooks or scripts
- Exercises and solutions
- Notes and concepts learned

---
## 📅 Structure
├── README.md ← General repository overview
├── day1/ ← SQL basics
│ ├── README.md
