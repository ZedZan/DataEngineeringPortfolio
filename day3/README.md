# 📘 Day 3 — CTEs, Subqueries & Advanced SQL Logic

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn to write **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** for cleaner queries
- Use **subqueries** inside SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
- Compute **user-level metrics** like total and average spending
- Use **window functions** (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LEAD)
- Compare individual results to global aggregates
- Build more **realistic SQL queries for data engineering**

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- How to compute **average order value** using CTEs
- How to compare each user to the **global average** using CASE
- How to rank orders with **RANK()**
- How to compute **previous order value and differences** using `LAG()`
- Proper use of **window functions** for advanced analysis

## 📝 Notes
- This day focuses on multi-step queries using CTEs + window functions
- These skills are essential for:
  - SQL interviews
  - Analytical reporting
  - Data engineering pipelines
